Problems:
 * features are rarely independent from each other
 * bugs that surface only when features interact with each other

Solution:
 * tourist metaphor
   * decomposition based on _intent_ rather than features/structure
   * to see as much as possible in as short period time as possible
   * to choose a mix of landmarks to visit
   * tourist guidebooks segment destination into districts

Districts:
 * Business district
   * "Back of the box" features
   * that appear in marketing/sales demo
 * Historical district
   * Legacy code
   * poorly understood
 * Tourist district
   * attract novice users
   * experience users seldom use
 * Entertainment district
   * supportive features
   * fill out the corners
 * Hotel district
   * test software when it is "at rest"
   * ??? 
 * Seedy district
   * places where ppl doing bad & illegal things
   * places of vulnerability
